oL Match Outcome Predictor is a machine learning-based tool developed as part of my academic project to predict the outcomes of League of Legends (LoL) matches. This product uses historical data, player statistics, and champion performance to generate accurate predictions for upcoming matches.

The system works by analyzing match data, such as player rankings, win rates with specific champions, and team compositions. By leveraging APIs like match, summoner, and champion from Riot Games, it provides predictions on which team is more likely to win and highlights key factors that influence the matchâ€™s outcome.

This project is designed to help players, analysts, and esports fans make data-driven decisions, and better understand the dynamics that affect game results. With machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost, the predictions improve over time as more data is fed into the system.

As a part of my project, this tool provides valuable insights into match outcomes based on various game metrics, offering an opportunity to explore machine learning in the context of esports.
